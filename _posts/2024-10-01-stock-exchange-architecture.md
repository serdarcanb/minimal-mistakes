# **1. System Architecture Design**

## **a. Microservice Architecture**

 ![image.png](https://serdarcanb.github.io/assets/images/System-Architecture-Design-01.png)

### **i.  Advantages of Microservices:**

- **Independent Development and Deployment:** Microservices can be developed and deployed separately, increasing team efficiency and allowing for isolated changes.
- **Technology Flexibility:** The most suitable technology can be chosen for each service, for example, based on performance or development speed requirements. (Flexible choice of programming language)
- **Fault Tolerance:** The failure of one microservice does not affect the entire system. This feature enhances overall system reliability.

### **ii. Use of Load Balancer:**

- **API Gateway:** Provides security and routing as a central access point.
- **Load Balancing and Caching:** Distributes requests, stores frequently used data.
- **Security and Monitoring:** Provides features such as JWT authentication, rate limiting, and request tracking.

With microservice architecture, we can scale our services in a more controlled and flexible manner. This architecture provides greater flexibility to our system. This situation gives us advantages in traffic management, security, and many other areas.

As shown in the image, after an incoming request, we can route requests directly to the desired endpoints of our services through a load balancer (Load Balancer L4) and a Layer 7 component such as an API Gateway. This structure ensures security with JWT while allowing our service to continue operating unaffected in case any pod crashes. Thus, we can directly provide high availability.

## **b. Real-Time Updates**

 ![image.png](https://serdarcanb.github.io/assets/images/System-Architecture-Design-02.png)

### **i. Event-Driven Architecture:**

- **Event Producers and Consumers:** Services within the system produce events (for example, a new transaction order or price update) and other relevant services consume these events.
- **Loose Coupling:** Services are independent from each other and interact through events rather than direct communication. This increases the flexibility of the system.

### **ii. Messaging System Integration:**

- **Use of Apache Kafka:**
    - **High Efficiency and Low Latency:** Kafka is optimized for processing high-volume data streams with minimal delay.
    - **Persistent Log Structure:** Messages are stored permanently on disk, minimizing data loss risk.
    - **Partitioning:** Data is segmented into partitions based on specific key values, enhancing scalability.
- **Use of RabbitMQ:**
    - **Routing and Queuing:** Offers sophisticated features for directing messages to various queues and processing them.
    - **Acknowledge Mechanism:** Ensures reliability by confirming successful message processing.

## **c. Transactional Integrity**

### **i. ACID-Compliant Databases:**

- **ACID:**
    - **Atomicity:** Transactions either complete entirely or not at all.
    - **Consistency:** The database remains in a consistent state before and after transactions.
    - **Isolation:** Concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other.
    - **Durability:** Once a transaction is completed, data is permanently stored.
- **Database Selection:**
    - **PostgreSQL:**
        - **Robust ACID Properties:** Ideal for complex transactions.
        - **Extensive Plugin Support:** Customizable for specific needs.
    - **Oracle:**
        - **Enterprise-Level Features:** Suitable for large-scale and critical applications.
        - **Advanced Security and Management Tools:** Offers sophisticated security and data management capabilities.

### **ii. Distributed Transactions and Saga Pattern:**

- **Saga Pattern:**
    - **Management of Distributed Transactions:** Used to handle long-running transactions across microservices.
    - **Transaction Steps and Compensation Mechanisms:** Each step defines a transaction and, if necessary, a method to reverse (compensate) this transaction.
- **Implementation Approaches:**
    - **Choreographed Sagas:**
        - **Event-Driven:** Services progress transactions by reacting to events.
        - **Loose Coupling:** Operates without a central coordinator.
            
            ![image.png](https://serdarcanb.github.io/assets/images/System-Architecture-Design-03.png)
            
    - **Orchestrated Sagas:**
        - **Central Coordinator:** An orchestrator service manages the transaction flow.
        - **Controlled Flow:** The sequence and logic of transaction steps are centrally determined.

## **d. High Availability and Scalability**

### **i. Use of Containerization and Kubernetes:**

- **Containerization with Docker, Containerd, and Podman:**
    - **Portability:** Applications and their dependencies are packaged within containers, ensuring consistent operation across different environments.
    - **Resource Isolation:** Each container uses its own resources, enhancing security and performance.
- **Orchestration with Kubernetes:**
    - **Automatic Scaling (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler):** Dynamically adjusts the number of pods based on system load.
    - **Self-Healing:** Automatically restarts pods that have crashed or are unresponsive.
    - **Load Balancing:** Distributes incoming traffic evenly among working pods.
- **Deployment Strategies:**
    - **Blue/Green Deployment:** New and old versions run simultaneously; traffic is redirected to the new version before the old version is removed.
        
        ![image.png](https://serdarcanb.github.io/assets/images/System-Architecture-Design-05.png)
        
    - **Canary Deployment:** The new version is initially presented to a small group of users; if no issues arise, it is rolled out to all users.
        
        ![image.png](https://serdarcanb.github.io/assets/images/System-Architecture-Design-06.png)
        

### **ii. Load Balancing and Traffic Management:**

- **Use of NGINX or HAProxy:**
    - **Reverse Proxy and Load Balancer:** Balances incoming requests across servers.
    - **SSL/TLS Termination:** Manages secure connections and performs decryption on the load balancer.
        
        ![image.png](https://serdarcanb.github.io/assets/images/System-Architecture-Design-07.png)
        
- **Service Mesh (e.g., Istio):**
    - **Managing Microservice Communication:** Routes and controls traffic between services.
    - **Security and Policies:** Provides communication policies, security features, and monitoring capabilities.

## **e. Cloud Infrastructure and Distribution**

### **i. Multi-Region and Data Center Usage:**

- **Geographical Redundancy:**
    - **High Availability:** Service interruptions are minimized by using data centers in different geographical regions.
    - **Disaster Recovery:** If one region fails, another continues to provide service.
- **Data Replication:**
    - **Synchronous and Asynchronous Replication:** Critical data is copied to databases in other regions either in real-time or at specific intervals.

### **ii. Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**

- **Using Terraform:**
    - **Defining Cloud Resources with Code:** Resources such as servers, networks, and databases are defined and managed as code.
    - **Version Control:** Infrastructure code is stored in source control systems, enabling tracking and rollback of changes.

**Summary**

To ensure real-time updates, transactional integrity, and high availability, I would design the system architecture as a microservice architecture. Using **Containerd** for containerization and **Kubernetes** for orchestration, I would make the services independent and scalable. For real-time data flow, I would implement an **Event-Driven Architecture** with messaging systems like **Apache Kafka** or **RabbitMQ**, enabling me to process high-volume messages with low latency. To maintain transactional integrity, I would use **ACID**-compliant databases (such as **PostgreSQL**, **Oracle**) and implement patterns like the **Saga Pattern** to manage distributed transactions. For high availability, I would deploy across multiple regions on **AWS**, **Azure**, or **Google Cloud Platform**, manage traffic using load balancing with **NGINX** or **HAProxy**, and ensure uninterrupted service operation.

# **2. Processing Sequential Updates and Preventing Data Loss/Delay**

## **a. Sequential Data Processing**

### **i. Apache Kafka's Sequential Processing Features:**

- **Partitioning and Ordered Logs:**
    - **Partition Key:** Data is assigned to partitions using a specific key (e.g., user ID or transaction ID).
    - **Sequence Guarantee:** Messages within the same partition are consumed in the order they were produced.
- **Consumer Groups:**
    - **Scalability:** Multiple consumers share the load across partitions, enabling scalable consumption.
    - **Offset Management:** Consumers record the offset of the last message they've read, allowing them to resume from where they left off.

## **b. Preventing Data Loss**

### **i. Data Replication:**

- **Replication Factor in Kafka:**
    - **High Availability:** Each partition is replicated across different brokers with a specific replication factor.
    - **Leader and Follower Brokers:** For each partition, there is one leader and one or more followers. When the leader broker becomes unavailable, one of the followers takes over leadership.

### **ii. Acknowledgment (ACK) Mechanisms:**

![image.png](https://serdarcanb.github.io/assets/images/System-Architecture-Design-08.png)

- **On the Producer Side:**
    - **acks=all Setting:** The producer waits for confirmation that the message has been written to all replicas.
    - **Retry Mechanism:** If message sending fails, the producer automatically retries.
- **On the Consumer Side:**
    - **Manual Acknowledgment:** The consumer manually updates the offset after successfully processing the message.
    - **At-Least-Once Processing Semantics:** Messages are guaranteed to be processed at least once, but there is a possibility of the same message being processed more than once.

## **c. Minimizing Delay**

### **i. Servers Close to Users (Edge Computing):**

- **Use of CDN:**
    - **Distribution of Static Content:** Latency is reduced by serving content from the nearest point to users.
- **Edge Servers:**
    - **Moving Processing Power to the Edge:** Some processing loads are performed on servers close to users.

## **d. Idempotent Operations**

### **i. Idempotent Design Principles:**

- **Management of Repeated Requests:**
    - **Unique Request Identifier:** Each request is assigned a unique identifier to detect duplicates.
    - **State Check:** The system checks whether the operation has been performed before, and skips it if necessary.
- **Consistency of Operation Results:**
    - **Stateless Services:** Services not storing state information ensure operations are independent of each other.
    - **Cases Where State Storage is Necessary:** When state information is required, it is stored in a database or distributed cache.
    

**Summary**

To process sequential updates and prevent delay or data loss, I would prefer **Apache Kafka**. Kafka's sequential and persistent log structure ensures messages are processed in the correct order through **partitions** and **offsets**. To prevent data loss, I would increase the **replication factor** in Kafka, ensuring messages are stored on multiple brokers. By designing **idempotent** producers and consumers, I prevent repeated messages from affecting the system. To minimize delays, I would use low-latency network infrastructure, position servers close to users, or implement **edge computing** solutions. I would guarantee reliable message processing through **acknowledge** mechanisms and error management strategies.

**Summary**

To detect and respond to delays, failures, or anomalies in real-time, I would implement a comprehensive monitoring system. I'd use **Prometheus** to collect system metrics and **Grafana** for visualization, while employing **Jaeger** or **Zipkin** to monitor inter-microservice calls. For centralized log collection and analysis, I'd utilize the **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana). Automatic alerts based on predefined metric thresholds would be set up using **Alertmanager** or **PagerDuty**, with notifications sent to teams via **Slack**, email, or SMS. To identify unusual situations, I'd apply machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection. Quick responses to issues would be facilitated by **Kubernetes**' automatic scaling and self-healing capabilities.
